# Changelog

All notable changes to the `ech_http` package will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-29

### Changed
- Raise the default `maxConcurrentRequests` from 6 to 64 per client and add
  `maxConcurrentRequestsPerHost`, defaulting to 6 per URL hostname across ports
  and schemes. Scheduling skips saturated hosts while preserving queue order
  among eligible requests; redirects acquire the destination host's capacity.

### Fixed
- Release native request slots on completion or timeout even when the response
  body is unread or paused. Acknowledge body chunks when consumed to retain
  bounded buffering without pausing completion and error delivery.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-27

### Changed
- Advertise gzip by default and decode gzip response bodies on the native worker.
  This changes the previous raw-response default; use
  `EchClient(autoUncompress: false)` to retain compressed response bytes.
- Match Dart HttpClient / package:http IOClient negotiation and response length
  behavior: preserve wire headers and streamed contentLength, while buffered
  Response.contentLength remains the decoded body size.
- Apply the response size limit and native delivery budget to decoded bytes.
- Pin zlib 1.3.2 in all 14 prebuilt SDK targets and verify its source digest,
  static library, matching headers, and license during cache preparation.

### Added
- Gzip compression state, concatenated-member support, malformed/truncated
  stream errors, and IOClient compatibility and decoded-backpressure tests.

---

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-26

### Changed
- Replace the 10 ms response polling timer with native `Dart_PostCObject` events
  delivered through per-request receive ports, without `NativeCallable`.
- Preserve the 256 KiB streaming budget with body acknowledgements.
- Release request handles without joining network threads; retain worker state
  through cancellation and clean up abandoned handles with native finalizers.
- Update the internal C ABI and build hooks for Dart SDK message-port headers.

### Added
- Regression coverage for timer-free delivery, repeated stream pauses, bounded
  in-flight messages, closed ports, and isolate group shutdown during transfers.

---

## [0.1.2]

### Changed
- Update repository, issue tracker, dependency SDK download URLs, and maintainer tooling to the `ech-research` GitHub organization.
- Keep the existing SDK release versions and SHA-256 pins; no native dependency rebuild is required.

---

## [0.1.1]

### Added
- **Precompiled SDK Pipeline**: Added automated downloads of pinned, SHA-256-verified dependency SDKs from dedicated public GitHub Release repositories.
- **Offline Binary Caching**: Added reusable native binary cache via `hooks.user_defines.ech_http.binary_cache` with archive integrity validation, offline reuse, and automatic self-repair of damaged files.
- **Maintainer Automation**: Added `tool/update_prebuilt.py` for automated pinning and hash verification of new SDK release versions.
- **Live End-to-End Suite**: Added environment-variable-driven live network tests for ECH validation, authenticated retries, and proxy tunneling (`test/live_ech_test.dart`).

### Changed
- Move build helpers and dependency pins outside the reserved `hook/` directory for pub.dev upload compatibility.
- **Build Hook Acceleration**: Switched to compiling only the C++ bridge locally via CMake/Ninja (~15 s cold builds), eliminating local compilation of BoringSSL and libcurl from source.
- **Documentation Overhaul**: Restructured all project documentation, added comprehensive English and Chinese guides, Mermaid architecture diagrams, and multi-platform verification records.

### Removed
- Removed application-specific integration recipes in favor of generic, configurable discovery examples and resolvers.

---

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- **Core HTTP Client**: Initial release of `EchClient` implementing `package:http.Client`, backed by an in-process C++17 engine (libcurl + BoringSSL).
- **TLS Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)**: Full support for ECH negotiation, fail-closed security enforcement, and automated authenticated retries.
- **Routing & Resolvers**: Added `DohEchResolver` for DNS JSON HTTPS record (Type 65) discovery and `StaticEchResolver` for pre-configured routes.
- **Proxy & Physical Routing**: Supported HTTP CONNECT proxies, physical destination IP overrides (`addresses`), and custom PKI root injection (`trustedRootsPem`).
- **Native Assets Integration**: Supported cross-platform compilation and bundling for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows via Dart build hooks.
